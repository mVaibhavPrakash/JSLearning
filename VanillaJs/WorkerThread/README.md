## Here we see how worker thread works

*We will see two exmaples one with worker thread and one without worker thread*


# Example

**1. Without worker**
   **Files used:**
   1. **withoutWorker.html --->** This file contains UI for this examples and buttons for triggering events
   2. **nonworker.js --->** This file handles dom events

   *Run the file 'withoutWorker.html'. Now open the console in your web browser and press 'Click worker' button and suddenly try to press 'Click me!' button then you will see new*    *paragraph not appeared till event triggered by 'Click worker' not printed some value in console. It is because 'Click worker' button blocks the DOM thread till its execution*    *as both , the calculation by 'Click worker' and DOM event by 'Click me' is done on single main thread.*

**2. With worker**
   **Files used:**
   1. **withWorker.html --->** This file contains UI for this examples and buttons for triggering events
   2. **workerTriggerer.js --->** This file handles dom events and also craetes Worker object for worker.js file
   3. **worker.js --->** This file contains the code having some heavy calculation

   *Run the file 'withWorker.html' Now open the console in your web browser and press 'Click Worker' button and quickly click 'Click me!' button then you will see new paragraph*      *appeared without waiting for event triggered by 'Click worker' to print some value in console. It is beacuse now worker does all the calculations for us and thus DOM thread*      *run independently.*

### If you are not satisfied with these examples the change the value of 'data' variable in both 'workerTriggerer.js' and 'nonworker.js' and repeat the steps mentioned in both the ### examples and observe the behaviour of DOM. Shocked!!!!!!
